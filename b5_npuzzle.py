method breakdown:
    1. actions
        find a set of actions applicable to specified state
    2. result
        apply action to state and return new state
    3. goal_test
        Is state a goal?
    4. make_goal
        creates a matrix size x size
        placing none in the middle of the matrix
        if there is no middle of the matrix place it a the end
        example: size = 3
            [[1, 2, 3], [4, None, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
        example: size = 4
            [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, None]]
